    "Problem Statement",
    "Clouds and shadows hide surface observations in optical imagery. LISS-IV provides Green, Red and NIR bands without Blue or SWIR in this workflow. Reconstruction must respect those spectral limits and the uncertainty in estimating an unseen surface.",
  ],
  [
    "Research Objective",
    "Build a reproducible pipeline for ingesting georeferenced images, detecting obstructions, estimating masked values and evaluating against valid references. Every result must retain its acquisition metadata, input hash, model version and processing parameters.",
  ],
  [
    "Methodology",
    "Inspect actual raster bands and geographic extent. Define an area of interest, normalize radiometry, detect cloud/shadow or use a supplied mask, and process overlapping patches. Preserve clear pixels on the output grid and evaluate only where a legitimate paired reference exists.",
  ],
  [
    "Architecture",
    "A Next.js interface connects to an independent FastAPI service. PostgreSQL/PostGIS stores accounts, records and geographic footprints. Redis and Celery dispatch jobs to raster workers, while PyTorch handles neural training and inference. The hosted interface alone does not run the Python service.",
  ],
  [
    "Dataset",
    "Use licensed LISS-IV observations and verified band mappings. Same-sensor temporal imagery and calibrated Sentinel-1 VV/VH provide optional conditioning. Sentinel-2 and DEM files may be inventoried but are not consumed by the current reconstruction networks. Split geographic scenes before preparing patches.",
  ],
  [
    "Preprocessing",
    "Rasterio reads raster windows and aligns auxiliary imagery through their georeferencing. Reprojection and resampling are explicit options; they are not automatic image-based subpixel registration. The native processing grid is preserved unless a different output grid is requested.",
  ],
  [
    "Generative Models",
    "ResUNet provides a residual reconstruction path. The conditional GAN combines a reconstruction generator with PatchGAN discrimination. Conditional DDPM predicts noise over a diffusion schedule. All learned paths remain unavailable without compatible registered safetensors weights.",
  ],
  [
    "Multi-Sensor Fusion",
    "The multimodal diffusion network combines optical observations, masks and temporal conditioning with a separate SAR encoder. Pooled cross-attention integrates radar features. Calibration ranges and alignment must match the training configuration; missing auxiliary coverage causes an explicit failure.",
  ],
  [
    "Evaluation",
    "MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, SAM and ERGAS are calculated from actual aligned references over all, cloud, shadow and clear regions. NoData is excluded. A different-date temporal image is not ground truth, so it does not produce accuracy scores. NDVI uses the recorded band scales and offsets.",
  ],
  [
    "Experiments",
    "Training and validation histories are measured during actual optimization. Keep training, validation and test scenes disjoint, document random seeds and preserve input hashes. Small synthetic test runs verify engineering behavior; they do not demonstrate performance on real LISS-IV acquisitions.",
  ],
  [
    "Limitations",
    "Reconstructed pixels are estimates. Bright roofs, snow and haze can confuse threshold cloud detection. Temporal change and imperfect alignment can invalidate comparisons. No calibrated uncertainty model is supplied, and no scientific accuracy or benchmark improvement is claimed.",
  ],
  [
    "Future Work",
    "Train and validate on independent licensed data, calibrate uncertainty, evaluate improved cloud detectors and image registration, and measure full-resolution throughput. Operational work includes distributed recovery, storage quotas, retention policies and deployment load testing.",
